# Production Environment

This site is primarily developed on a Mac and deployed on Linux. There are
likely some things that won't work on Windows.

## Virtualenv Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/active
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
```

## Secrets

In production mode, the app will try to read `./secrets.yml` to load in the
GitHub application keys and the Rollbar account information for error tracking.
The [secrets-example.yml](secrets-example.yml) file has the format and links
to sign up for the free accounts necessary.

## Assets

To compile the JS and CSS for production usage, run the following:

```
python compile.py prod
```

This will create the necessary minified JS and CSS files in the `public/`
folder.

## Running

To start the app in production mode, run:

```
bash prod.sh
```

## Deployment

This will start up a number of workers on a unix socket at
`/var/tmp/uwsgi-packagecontrol.io.socket` using the uwsgi
protocol. Youâ€™ll need to run nginx or Apache in front and proxy the
request to uwsgi.

Nginx includes uwsgi support by default, so basic proxying will be something
along the lines of:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name packagecontrol.io;

    root /path/to/packagecontrol.io;

    gzip on;
    gzip_disable "msie6";
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json text/javascript application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss image/svg+xml;

    try_files /public/$uri /app/html/$uri @uwsgi;

    location @uwsgi {
        uwsgi_pass  unix:/var/tmp/uwsgi-packagecontrol.io.socket;
        include     uwsgi_params;
    }
}
```

The full production environment does more in regards to using lua to graph
activity, etc.
