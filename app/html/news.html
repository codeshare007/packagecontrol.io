    There are quite a number of guides online that will help you set up your
    machines so that your Sublime Text packages and settings are copied from
    one computer to another. Unfortunately most of these guides do not take
    into consideration the fact that some packages have different versions for
    different operating systems.
</p>

<p>
    This morning I've added a new page to the <a href="/docs">Docs section</a>
    titled <a href="/docs/syncing">Syncing</a>. It explains the potential
    issues with syncing packages and has some guidance for using Git and
    Dropbox. Please let me know if you have any improvements for this,
    or any of the other documentation by filling out a
    <a href="https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/issues">GitHub issue</a>.

    As part of the new site launch and the expanded package detail pages, I
    wanted to start an experiment with making supporting package developers
    even easier. Now granted, the part I'm playing in the process is rather
    small since I am just providing links for each author. The real work that
    makes this possible is <a href="https://www.gittip.com">Gittip</a>, founded
    by <a href="https://www.gittip.com/whit537/">Chad Whitacre</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I was excited a few weeks ago to see the attention Gittip received when
    <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/gittip-at-khan-academy/">John Resig announced</a> the Khan Academy has started giving their developers
    $5 a week to say thank you to the open source developers who make their
    work possible.
</p>

<p>
    My hope is that through exposing the work of the over 1,000 developers
    who maintain various packages for Sublime Text, we can encourage each other
    to say “thank you!”
</p>

<p>
    In case you’ve never checked it out, Gittip offers weekly donation amounts
    as small as $0.25. This may seen inconsequential, however if only 100 users
    tip $0.25 a week, the developer can recieve $25. Considering there are
    tens of thousands of users of some of the more popular packages, it should
    be possible for these small donations to make a big impact and encourage
    future open source work.
</p>

<p>
    In closing I wanted to highlight some of the work a few contributors to
    Package Control have been doing over the past months. These developers have
    spent their time reviewing and giving feedback to fellow package developers
    as they merge pull requests into the default channel:

<h2 id="2013-08-09-New_Website">New Package Control Website</h2>

<p>
    The old Community Packages list that was hosted on my website was admittedly
    a quick and dirty hack to make it easier for users to try and find packages.
    I have always known there were many usability issues and tons of room for
    improvement.
</p>

<p>
    When the first alpha of Sublime Text 3 was announced, I knew there was
    quite a bit of work ahead of me to adapt the architecture to support
    multiple versions of Sublime Text. I also saw this as the opportunity to
    converge the codebase from python (for Package Control) and PHP (for the
    old Community Packages list) to a single re-usable library.
</p>

<p>
    Along the way of pursuing that goal, I vastly expanded the information that
    can be provided by the channel system. This information helps greatly
    enhance the new Package Control site to include in-depth information about
    every package.
</p>

<p>
    I am sure many of you have already poked around a bit, but here are some
    highlights of the new site:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            A detail page for every package, including the usual info, plus:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Installs graph for the past month, with toggles per platform</li>
            <li>Links to the bug tracker and a donation page</li>
            <li>Inline readme content to learn more about the package</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        HTML content on initial page load with JSON-powered pushState architecture
        for all subsequent requests, leading to a more fluid browsing experience
    </li>
    <li>
        JSON versions of all data accessible by appending <tt>.json</tt> to
        most URLs
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsive design that allows for easy browsing on
        desktop, tablet and phone
    </li>
    <li>
        Retina-friendly design with all vector graphics
    </li>
    <li>
        Open source - in the coming days the full website source code will
        be posted with a permissive license on GitHub for collaboration
    </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
    After many months of waiting, Package Control 2.0 is finally ready.
    This launch is the culmination of hundreds of commits and includes many new
    features.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Sublime Text 3 support, including support for different versions of
        packages for either Sublime Text 2 or Sublime Text 3.
    </li>
    <li>
        The new WinINet downloader on Windows that hooks into the OS subsystem
        for downloading files from the internet. This vastly improves proxy
        support and eliminates the need for distributing SSL CA certificates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Updated downloaders for OS X and Linux that utilize the operating
        systems’ SSL CA cert bundles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Proper package installation in ST3 via <tt>.sublime-package</tt> files.
        This allows users to override individual files in a package with their
        own version. <em>Packages that must be unpacked simply need to have a
        file named <tt>.no-sublime-package</tt> in the root of the package.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        A completely revamped schema for channel and repositories making it
        much easier to properly add packages to the channel, easily override
        package details and provide more information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for easy package releases using tags.
    </li>
    <li>
        A labels system for categorizing packages.
    </li>
    <li>
        A migration to semver.org for versioning semantics, along with an
        option to ignore pre-release package versions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Caching support for HTTP requests, allowing for more custom
        GitHub-based repositories without hitting the hourly rate limit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep-Alive support for the Urllib downloader, making multiple requests
        to the same server much faster and less error prone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many, many bug fixes and small user enhancements.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The time has come where I can’t in good conscience keep the BitBucket mirror
    of the default channel open for pull requests. Due to the sheer number of
    pull requests that come in we currently have three very regular volunteers
    reviewing all requests on GitHub. Unfortunately the volume is so low on
    BitBucket that it tends to be forgotten. Having a repository actively
    maintained in two version control systems presents other problems when
    trying to automate maintenance tasks.
</p>
<p>
    While I’ve always strived to provide as much compatibility as possible for
    my various open source projects, I think the result of shuttering the
    BitBucket mirror will be net positive. Thanks to the website-based edit
    functionality of GitHub and the current TravisCI testing setup, package
    developers who aren’t familiar with git should have no trouble adding
    entries for their packages.

<h2 id="2013-07-31-Resetting_Statistics">Resetting Statistics</h2>

<p>
    Some users may have noticed a brief outage on the default channel server.
    Just now I took the channel offline to corrent a long-running glitch in
    package install statistics.
</p>
<p>
    Due to a bug in the script that handled usage submissions from Package
    Control, all operations including upgrades and removals were being counted
    as installs. This manifested itself more severly for packages that have
    had lots of versions. Each time a new version of the package was released
    and users upgraded, installs and unique installs were incorrectly being
    increased.
</p>
<p>
    From early in the project I decided to maintain a full history of every
    usage submission in case information needed to be reconstructed. The brief
    outage that users experienced was a full wipe of all install statistics
    and a regeneration of them from the master usage table. Over 35 million
    submissions were processed and tallied up into new, much more accurate
    statistics.
</p>
<p>
    The unfortunately downside of this is that many package developers will see
    a dip in their install numbers. With the upcoming release of Package
    Control 2.0 and the new website, the source code for recording and
    displaying all of this information will be open source. Hopefully this will
    present the opportunity for other developers to both help improve, but also
    review the codebase to help catch such mistakes sooner.
</p>
