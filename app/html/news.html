    </p>

    <p>
        I‘m pleased to announce the release of Package Control 3.0! This release
        adds a bunch of polish, improving the Sublime Text experience for users
        and package developers.
    </p>

    <p>
        As of July 2014, I now work for myself. This has allowed me to spend more
        time working on open source software, including Package Control. If you
        appreciate the work I‘ve done, please consider a small donation. If even
        5% of regular users donated the price of a coffee or beer, that would cover
        quite a bit of my development time! See the <a href="/about">About</a> page
        for options.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following notes detail some of the bigger aspects of this new release.
    </p>

    <h3>Backwards Compatibility Breaks</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            For users who have a custom SSL CA certs, please note that any custom certs
            must now be stored in <tt>Packages/User/Package Control.user-ca-bundle</tt>.
            This mechanism replaces the old <tt>certs</tt> setting. In general this
            should not be necessary since Package Control now utilizes OS certificate
            stores for CA certs.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <em>Create Binary Package File</em> command was removed, but replaced
            with the <tt>package_profiles</tt> setting which allows for any number of
            different package creation configurations. See
            <a href="/docs/creating_package_files">Creating Package Files</a> for more
            details.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dependencies</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Package Control now supports package dependencies for the sake of shipping
            non-user-facing binary files that are needed by packages. These will commonly
            include compiled Python modules and executables. To learn more, read the
            <a href="/docs/dependencies">Dependencies documentation</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            A package loader that is run before any other non-default packages. This adds
            dependency folders to <tt>sys.path</tt> and makes the <tt>package_control</tt>
            Python module always available, instead of waiting until Sublime Text loads
            up all  packages that are alphabetically before <tt>Package Control</tt>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Upgrades</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Improved handling of package upgrades involving editor customizations.
            Theme, Color Scheme and Syntax upgrades will no longer cause Sublime Text
            error messages. If a package containing one of these is being upgraded,
            Package Control will change the setting back to the default just before
            starting. Once complete, the customized settings will be restored.
        </li>
        <li>
            In-use file upgrades improved. Package Control performs extra steps on
            Windows to allow upgrades to occur for packages that use various binary
            files such as DLLs and executables.
        </li>
        <li>
            A package event API was added to allow packages to know if they were just
            installed, are about to be upgraded, were just upgraded, or are about to be
            removed. See the <a href="/docs/events">Events documentation</a> for more
            details.
        </li>
        <li>
            Package upgrades that are interupted by Sublime Text being closed or
            restarted will no longer result in packages being left in the
            <tt>ignored_packages</tt> setting.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Commands</h3>

    <p>
        Additional commands were added to the command palette, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Advanced Install Package</strong> install packages via a
            comma-separated list
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>List Unmanaged Packages</strong> list packages not controlled via
            Package Control
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Remove Channel</strong> helper to remove a channel
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Remove Repository</strong> helper to remove a repository
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Syncing</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Package Control will now remove packages, upon start, that have been deleted
            from the <tt>installed_packages</tt> list. This improves the
            <a href="/docs/syncing">recommended configuration</a> of just syncing the
            <tt>Packages/User/</tt> folder.
       </li>
       <li>
            Incorrect syncing of packages will now be detected and users will be
            notified of the issue. Sync warnings will only be raised when a package for
            a specific platform or version of Sublime Text is copied to an incompatible
            machine.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Python Patches</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Upgraded SSL support for Sublime Text 2 on Windows. <tt>_ssl.pyd</tt> files
            are installed for ST2 on Windows that are compiled against the latest version
            of OpenSSL. This allows secure connections to validate modern SSL
            certificates that use SHA-2 signatures.
        </li>
        <li>
            Package Control now patches the Python <tt>select</tt> module for Sublime
            Text 2 on Windows. This patch will make the <tt>select</tt> module
            available for use by all packages.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            All repositories and packages are now required to use SSL for improved
            security.
        </li>
        <li>
            SSL support for Linux. Package Control now ships <tt>_ssl.so</tt> files
            that are compatible with OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.x (both <tt>libssl-1.0.0</tt>
            and <tt>libssl-10</tt>). Thanks to the new package loader, these are injected
            before any other packages are loaded. Gone are the days of package developers
            having to bundle them individually, or using curl/wget.
        </li>
        <li>
            SSL CA certificates are now 100% sourced from the OS. Previously Package
            Control included functionality to distribute SSL CA certificates to allow
            validation of SSL certs on OS X and Windows. With version 3.0, Package
            Control can now explort SSL CA certs from the Windows trust store into the
            format necessary for OpenSSL. This allows PC to no longer be responsible for
            distributing SSL CA certs in a secure way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added a parser that allows Package Control to validate SSL certificates using
            <tt>SubjectAltName</tt> fields for certs that are valid for multiple
            hostnames. Previously such certificates were only supported in Sublime Text 3.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HTTP</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            A revised Urllib-based downloader for Windows. In version 2.0, Package
            Control switched from using urllib for downloads to using the WinINet API
            on Windows. This allowed PC to delegate all of the work of proxy
            auto-detection and SSL verification to the OS. Unfortunately some users
            are unable to connect to the internet using WinINet due to local policies.
            Other users experienced issues with SSL connectivity through the WinINet API.
            As of version 3.0, Package Control will automatically fall back to the urllib
            downloader if WinINet is unable to connect.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTTP compression based on bzip2 is now used for the channel file to reduce
            bandwidth usage. Every Sublime Text install will now have the <tt>bz2</tt>
            module available for use by other packages.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Repositories and Channels</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            A new <tt>schema_version</tt> of the channel and repository JSON files was
            released that supports using prefixed tags to allow for semantic versions
            with separate code-bases for different versions of Sublime Text. See the
            <a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control/blob/master/example-repository.json">example-repository.json</a>
            for details.
        </li>
        <li>
            A new package, <a href="/packages/ChannelRepositoryTools">ChannelRepositoryTools</a>,
            was released that provides commands for package developers to upgrade their
            older repository JSON files to the newest standard. Read
            <a href="/docs/channels_and_repositories#Upgrading">Channels and Repositories</a>
            for more information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>

    <p>
        Various documentation on the website has been added, or improved, including:
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        After a couple of months of bug fixes and feature development, I‘m excited
        to announce the first Package Control 3.0 beta! Over the next few days
        I would like to get it in the hands of a bunch of users to work out any
        final kinks. Hopefully 3.0 will be a little less eventful than the 2.0
        rollout.
    </p>

    <p>
        A set of full release notes will be displayed via Package Control messages,
        however here are some highlights:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>depedency support</li>
        <li>an SSL module for Linux</li>
        <li>error-free theme, color scheme and syntax upgrades</li>
        <li>improved HTTP support on Windows</li>
        <li>functionality to sync package removals via the <em>User/</em> folder</li>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are willing to help, perform the following instructions to
        upgrade to version <tt>3.0.0-beta</tt>. Once upgraded, keep an eye
        on the Sublime Text console for Python exceptions. If you experience any
        issues, please

    <p>
        There are quite a number of guides online that will help you set up your
        machines so that your Sublime Text packages and settings are copied from
        one computer to another. Unfortunately most of these guides do not take
        into consideration the fact that some packages have different versions for
        different operating systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        This morning I've added a new page to the <a href="/docs">Docs section</a>
        titled <a href="/docs/syncing">Syncing</a>. It explains the potential
        issues with syncing packages and has some guidance for using Git and
        Dropbox. Please let me know if you have any improvements for this,
        or any of the other documentation by filling out a

    </p>

    <p>
        As part of the new site launch and the expanded package detail pages, I
        wanted to start an experiment with making supporting package developers
        even easier. Now granted, the part I'm playing in the process is rather
        small since I am just providing links for each author. The real work that
        makes this possible is <a href="https://www.gittip.com">Gittip</a>, founded
        by <a href="https://www.gittip.com/whit537/">Chad Whitacre</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was excited a few weeks ago to see the attention Gittip received when
        <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/gittip-at-khan-academy/">John Resig announced</a> the Khan Academy has started giving their developers
        $5 a week to say thank you to the open source developers who make their
        work possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        My hope is that through exposing the work of the over 1,000 developers
        who maintain various packages for Sublime Text, we can encourage each other
        to say “thank you!”
    </p>

    <p>
        In case you’ve never checked it out, Gittip offers weekly donation amounts
        as small as $0.25. This may seen inconsequential, however if only 100 users
        tip $0.25 a week, the developer can recieve $25. Considering there are
        tens of thousands of users of some of the more popular packages, it should
        be possible for these small donations to make a big impact and encourage
        future open source work.
    </p>

    <p>
        In closing I wanted to highlight some of the work a few contributors to
        Package Control have been doing over the past months. These developers have
        spent their time reviewing and giving feedback to fellow package developers
        as they merge pull requests into the default channel:

    <h2 id="2013-08-09-New_Website">New Package Control Website</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        by <span class="by">wbond</span>
        at <span class="time">2:32pm</span>
        on <span class="date">Friday, August 9th, 2013</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        The old Community Packages list that was hosted on my website was admittedly
        a quick and dirty hack to make it easier for users to try and find packages.
        I have always known there were many usability issues and tons of room for
        improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the first alpha of Sublime Text 3 was announced, I knew there was
        quite a bit of work ahead of me to adapt the architecture to support
        multiple versions of Sublime Text. I also saw this as the opportunity to
        converge the codebase from python (for Package Control) and PHP (for the
        old Community Packages list) to a single re-usable library.
    </p>

    <p>
        Along the way of pursuing that goal, I vastly expanded the information that
        can be provided by the channel system. This information helps greatly
        enhance the new Package Control site to include in-depth information about
        every package.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am sure many of you have already poked around a bit, but here are some
        highlights of the new site:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                A detail page for every package, including the usual info, plus:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Installs graph for the past month, with toggles per platform</li>
                <li>Links to the bug tracker and a donation page</li>
                <li>Inline readme content to learn more about the package</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML content on initial page load with JSON-powered pushState architecture
            for all subsequent requests, leading to a more fluid browsing experience
        </li>
        <li>
            JSON versions of all data accessible by appending <tt>.json</tt> to
            most URLs
        </li>
        <li>
            Responsive design that allows for easy browsing on
            desktop, tablet and phone
        </li>
        <li>
            Retina-friendly design with all vector graphics
        </li>
        <li>
            Open source - in the coming days the full website source code will
            be posted with a permissive license on GitHub for collaboration
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="2013-08-09-Package_Control_2">Package Control 2.0</h2>
    <p class="meta">
        by <span class="by">wbond</span>
        at <span class="time">2:11pm</span>
        on <span class="date">Friday, August 9th, 2013</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        After many months of waiting, Package Control 2.0 is finally ready.
        This launch is the culmination of hundreds of commits and includes many new
        features.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Sublime Text 3 support, including support for different versions of
            packages for either Sublime Text 2 or Sublime Text 3.
        </li>
        <li>
            The new WinINet downloader on Windows that hooks into the OS subsystem
            for downloading files from the internet. This vastly improves proxy
            support and eliminates the need for distributing SSL CA certificates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Updated downloaders for OS X and Linux that utilize the operating
            systems’ SSL CA cert bundles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Proper package installation in ST3 via <tt>.sublime-package</tt> files.
            This allows users to override individual files in a package with their
            own version. <em>Packages that must be unpacked simply need to have a
            file named <tt>.no-sublime-package</tt> in the root of the package.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            A completely revamped schema for channel and repositories making it
            much easier to properly add packages to the channel, easily override
            package details and provide more information.
        </li>
        <li>
            Support for easy package releases using tags.

    <p>
        The time has come where I can’t in good conscience keep the BitBucket mirror
        of the default channel open for pull requests. Due to the sheer number of
        pull requests that come in we currently have three very regular volunteers
        reviewing all requests on GitHub. Unfortunately the volume is so low on
        BitBucket that it tends to be forgotten. Having a repository actively
        maintained in two version control systems presents other problems when
        trying to automate maintenance tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I’ve always strived to provide as much compatibility as possible for
        my various open source projects, I think the result of shuttering the
        BitBucket mirror will be net positive. Thanks to the website-based edit
        functionality of GitHub and the current TravisCI testing setup, package
        developers who aren’t familiar with git should have no trouble adding
        entries for their packages.

        Some users may have noticed a brief outage on the default channel server.
        Just now I took the channel offline to corrent a long-running glitch in
        package install statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to a bug in the script that handled usage submissions from Package
        Control, all operations including upgrades and removals were being counted
        as installs. This manifested itself more severly for packages that have
        had lots of versions. Each time a new version of the package was released
        and users upgraded, installs and unique installs were incorrectly being
        increased.
    </p>
    <p>
        From early in the project I decided to maintain a full history of every
        usage submission in case information needed to be reconstructed. The brief
        outage that users experienced was a full wipe of all install statistics
        and a regeneration of them from the master usage table. Over 35 million
        submissions were processed and tallied up into new, much more accurate
        statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        The unfortunately downside of this is that many package developers will see
        a dip in their install numbers. With the upcoming release of Package
        Control 2.0 and the new website, the source code for recording and
        displaying all of this information will be open source. Hopefully this will
        present the opportunity for other developers to both help improve, but also
        review the codebase to help catch such mistakes sooner.
