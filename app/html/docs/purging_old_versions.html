<h1>Purging Old Versions</h1>

<p>
	During the alpha phase of Package Control 2.0, quite a number of users
	installed Package Control via git. However, with version 2.0.0-alpha7 there
	was a bug that prevented automatically upgrading Package Control itself.
	Because of this, there are quite a number of users still running old
	versions of Package Control. These instructions will step through purging
	the old version of Package Control and upgrading to a stable release.
