<h1>Events</h1>

<p>
	Package Control 3.0 adds an API for package developers to be able to more
	easily respond to events that affect their packages. The events API is used
	in concert with the Sublime Text package load/unload handlers.
</p>

<p>
	The following events can be detected:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>After Install</li>
	<li>Before Upgrade</li>
	<li>After Upgrade</li>
	<li>Before Removal</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<em><strong>Please note that this API is only available starting with
	Package Control 3.0.</strong> Users who have not upgraded to 3.0 will not
	have the <tt>package_control</tt> modules available to all packages and
	errors will occur. In an effort to solve this issue, the old channel files
	for Package Control 1.x and 2.0 will only contain Package Control itself as
	of early January 2015. This will ensure that only Package Control 3.0 users
	will be installing and upgrading packages, making it possible for
	package developers to use the new events API and
	<a href="/docs/dependencies">dependencies</a>.</em>

<h2>Sublime Text Load/Unload Handlers</h2>

<p>
	The events API is a layer of extra information that allows code being run
	inside of the Sublime Text 3 <tt>plugin_loaded()</tt> and
	<tt>plugin_unloaded()</tt> handlers. These handlers are automatically
	executed whenever a package is install/enabled or removed/disabled,
	respectively.
</p>

<p>
	Part of what makes these handlers applicable is that Package Control
	always disables and reenables packages when performing operations on them.
	This helps ensure that Sublime Text does not parse partially extracted
	file contents or retain a filesystem lock on files about to be written or
	removed.
</p>

<p>
	Packages that run on Sublime Text 2 also have slightly different handlers.
	The example below will include code and comments showing how to support
	both ST2 and ST3.
</p>

<h2>API</h2>

<p>
	The events API is located in the <tt>package_control.events</tt> module.
	It has four functions. Each of these functions returns either a string
	version number, or <tt>None</tt> if the package is not in the state
	specified.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<tt>events.install("Package Name")</tt> - package was just installed
	</li>
	<li>
		<tt>events.pre_upgrade("Package Name")</tt> - package is about to be
		upgraded
	</li>
	<li>
		<tt>events.post_upgrade("Package Name")</tt> - package was just upgraded
	</li>
	<li>
		<tt>events.remove("Package Name")</tt> - package is about to be removed
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Code</h2>

<p>
	The following code should be located in one of the <tt>.py</tt> files in
	the root of your package.
</p>

<pre>import sys


package_name = 'My Package'


def plugin_loaded():
    from package_control import events

    if events.install(package_name):
        print('Installed %s!' % events.install(package_name))
    elif events.post_upgrade(package_name):
        print('Upgraded to %s!' % events.post_upgrade(package_name))


def plugin_unloaded():
    from package_control import events

    if events.pre_upgrade(package_name):
        print('Upgrading from %s!' % events.pre_upgrade(package_name))
    elif events.remove(package_name):
        print('Removing %s!' % events.remove(package_name))


# Compat with ST2
if sys.version_info &lt; (3,):
    plugin_loaded()
    unload_handler = plugin_unloaded
</pre>
