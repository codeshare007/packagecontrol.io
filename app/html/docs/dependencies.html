<h1>Dependencies</h1>

<p>
	One of the new features of Package Control 3.0 is support for dependencies.
	Dependencies are non-user-visible packages that contain binaries, shared
	libraries or Python modules. Dependencies are not a way to install multiple
	related packages. Currently no such functionality exists.
</p>

<p>
	<em><strong>Please note that this dependencies are only available starting
	with Package Control 3.0.</strong> Users who have not upgraded to 3.0 will
	not automatically download required dependencies. In an effort to solve this
	issue, the old channel files for Package Control 1.x and 2.0 will only
	contain Package Control itself as of early January 2015. This will ensure
	that only Package Control 3.0 users will be installing and upgrading
	packages, making it possible for package developers to use the dependencies
	and the <a href="/docs/events">events API</a>.</em>
</p>

<h2>How They Work</h2>

<p>
	Similar to packages, dependencies are distributed through a repository.
	Dependencies are always fully extracted to the user‘s <tt>Packages/</tt>
	folder, using their name. Thus, dependency and package names exist in a
	single namespace. This means you can not have a dependency with the same
	name as a package.
</p>

<p>
	Once the package is extracted, a custom-generated python file is added to
	a special package named <tt>0_package_control_loader</tt>. For Sublime
	Text 3, this is a <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file, whereas for Sublime Text
	2 it is just a folder. The reason for the name (and creating it as a
	<tt>.sublime-package</tt> file in ST3) is to ensure it is the very first
	non-default package that Sublime Text loads.
</p>

<p>
	The generated python file injects looks for predefined subfolder names in
	the dependency folder, based on the user‘s machine. Each matching subfolder
	that is found will be added to Python‘s <tt>sys.path</tt> list, which is
	used to load modules.
</p>

<p>
	The predefined subfolder names are in the formats:
	<tt>st{st_version}_{os}_{arch}</tt>, <tt>st{st_version}_{os}</tt> and
	<tt>st{st_version}</tt>. For example, Sublime Text 3 on a 64bit Linux
	machine, the following subfolders will be checked:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><tt>st3_linux_x64</tt></li>
	<li><tt>st3_linux</tt></li>
	<li><tt>st3</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
	The valid list of Sublime Text versions is: <tt>st2</tt> and
	<tt>st3</tt>. The valid list of operating systems is: <tt>windows</tt>,
	<tt>osx</tt> and <tt>linux</tt>. The valid list of architectures is:
	<tt>x32</tt> and <tt>x64</tt>.
</p>

<p>
	If for some reason you need different logic, create a single python file
	in the root folder of the dependency named <tt>loader.py</tt>. This python
	file would be fully responsible for making any and all changes necessary
	to <tt>sys.path</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
	If the explanation of how dependencies work seems kind of abstract, take
	a moment and look at the following examples:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/codexns/sublime-bz2">bz2</a> - a simple
		shared library that Package Control uses to obtain better compression
		of the default channel
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/codexns/sublime-cffi">cffi</a> - another
		standard dependency that makes a shared library available to all
		platforms and architectures
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/codexns/sublime-ssl-linux">ssl-linux</a> -
		a complex example using <tt>loader.py</tt> to determine what version
		of OpenSSL a user has installed
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Publishing</h2>

<p>
	Like packages, dependencies are distributed through repositories and cached
	in channels. See <a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control/blob/master/example-repository.json#L384-L440">example-repository.json</a> for the
	basic documentation on how to add a dependency to the repository JSON.
</p>

<p>
	The dependencies in the default repository are tracked in the file
	<a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/blob/master/repository/dependencies.json">repository/dependencies.json</a>. To add a new
	dependency, fork the channel and submit a pull request. Be sure to use the
	<a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ChannelRepositoryTools">ChannelRepositoryTools</a> to test your addition.
</p>

<h2>Using Dependencies</h2>

<p>
	To mark a package as requiring one or more dependencies, there are two
	options:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Add a <tt>dependencies</tt> key to one of the releases -
		<a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control/blob/master/example-repository.json#L248-L258">docs</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		Add a <tt>dependencies.json</tt> file to the root of the package -
		<a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control/blob/master/example-dependencies.json">docs</a>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	The <tt>dependencies.json</tt> approach will likely be more convenient for
	package developers since they will not be installing their own packages
	from a channel or repository.
