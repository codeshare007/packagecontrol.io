<h1>Submitting a Package</h1>

<p>
    One of the biggest reasons developers love Sublime Text is because of the
    package ecosystem that has developed. Package Control not only helps to
    make installing packages easier, but also has the goal of indexing all
    of the available pacakges.
</p>

<p>
    If you’ve taken the time to develop a package, please consider adding it to
    the default Package Control channel so users can easily install and keep
    your package up-to-date.
</p>

<h2>1. Reviewing Existing Packages</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Visit the <a href="/search">Search page</a> and look for similar
		packages.</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Try to improve an existing package before adding another.</b> When
		possible we strongly encourage working with an existing package
		maintainer to add functionality or tweak a package rather than
		proliferating lots of very similar options. This is especially true if
		your package is very simple.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Pick a Name</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Try not to use the word <tt>Sublime</tt> in your package name.</b>
		Every package available via Package Control is for Sublime Text. Using
		the word Sublime just adds noise to the list when trying to find
		packages. You can use the word <tt>Sublime</tt> in your marketing
		material, but omit it the package list, e.g. Sublime SFTP.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Don‘t use a name too similar to another.</b> We don‘t
		want <tt>SublimeTodo</tt> and <tt>Sublime T0d0</tt>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Use CamelCase or underscore_notation.</b> Other Python packages in
		ST3 will be able to more easily interact with it. Additionally, the
		search indexer will properly split words, making search results more
		accurate. Obviously this does not matter if your package name is a
		single word or contains no Python.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Do not use a <tt>.</tt> in the package name.</b> If you package
		includes any Python code, it will not load in ST3. This is because
		Python uses <tt>.</tt> as a folder separator when importing code.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Decide how to Host</h2>
<p>
	You‘ll need to pick <b>one</b> of the following two hosting options:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Use a public GitHub or BitBucket repository.</b> Only include one
		package per repository and be sure the root of the package is the root
		of the repository. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Host <tt>.sublime-package</tt> files and a <tt>packages.json</tt> on
		a web server.</b> For each release you‘ll need to create and upload
		a new package file and update the <tt>packages.json</tt> information.
		<em>This is rarely used.</em>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Pick a Versioning Strategy</h2>
<p>
	If you are using GitHub or BitBucket for your hosting, you will need to
	choose one of the following versioning strategies:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>RECOMMENDED: Use git/hg tags with each tag being a
		<a href="http://semver.org">semantic version number</a>.</b> This allows
		features like
		<a href="/docs/settings#setting-install_prereleases">install_prereleases</a>
		to work properly.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Use a branch of the repository, e.g. <tt>master</tt> or
		<tt>default</tt>.</b> For this versioning scheme, every commit is a new
		release and the version number is formulated from the latest commit
		date. <em>To properly use this, the branch used by you for development
		should be different than the release branch.</em>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Please note that once you use any semantic version numbers either via
	tags or manual releases, it will not be possible to go back to commit-based
	versioning. This is because all commit-based versions are prefixed with a
	<tt>0.</tt> when doing comparisons to allow for an upgrade path to explicit
	versioning.
</p>
<p>
	If you chose manual package hosting, you will need to use semantic
	versioning in your <tt>packages.json</tt> file.
</p>

<h2>5. Prepare Your Repository</h2>
<ol>
	
	<li>
		<b>Remove any <tt>.pyc</tt> files from your repository.</b> Sublime Text
		will generate the appropriate <tt>.pyc</tt> files the first time the
		package is loaded. Alos, different versions of Python use different
		formats.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Remove <tt>package-metadata.json</tt>.</b> This is automatically
		generated by Package Control when a package is installed and should not
		be in your repository.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. Add Your Repository to the Default Channel</h2>

<ol class="submit_package">
	<li>
		<b>Fork the
		<a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel">Package
		Control Channel</a>.</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<b>Add your package info to the appropriate JSON file
			in the <tt>repository/</tt> folder.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Example of GitHub hosting using semantic versioning via tags:
		</p>
		<pre>{
	"name": "Alignment",
	"details": "https://github.com/wbond/sublime_alignment",
	"releases": [
		{
			"sublime_text": "*",
			"details": "https://github.com/wbond/sublime_alignment/tags"
		}
	]
}</pre>
		<p>
			Example of BitBucket hosting using semantic versioning via tags:
		</p>
		<pre>{
	"name": "Alignment",
	"details": "https://bitbucket.org/wbond/sublime_alignment",
	"releases": [
		{
			"sublime_text": "*",
			"details": "https://bitbucket.org/wbond/sublime_alignment#tags"
		}
	]
}</pre>
		<p>
			For all other options, please read the documentation in the
			<a href="https://raw.github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/master/example-repository.json">example-repository.json</a>
			file.
		</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Make sure your package is in alphabetical order.</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Send a pull request.</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<b>Review the Travis CI test results on your pull request.</b>
			Whenever a pull request is submitted, a number of tests are run to
			ensure some basics about proper package info. If your pull request
			fails the tests, you‘ll need to look at the results and fix the
			issue.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just because your pull request passes the unit tests does not mean
			your request will be automatically merged! Reviewing pull requests
			is a thankless job, please be patient as we try to make everyone‘s
			Sublime Text package experience easier.
		</p>
