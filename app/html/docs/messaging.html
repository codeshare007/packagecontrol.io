<h1>Messaging</h1>

<p>
	If youâ€˜ve used many package with Sublime Text and Package Control, you may
	have noticed situations where Package Control shows messages. Currently it
	is possible to show users a message when the package is installed, or after
	upgrades.
</p>
<p>
	Messaging is controlled by a file named <tt>messages.json</tt> in the root
	of the package. The
	<em><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/master/example-messages.json">example-messages.json</a></em>
	file shows the proper structure of the json. Each value will be a file path
	that is relative to the package root. Each key will either be the
	string <tt>install</tt> or a version number.
</p>

<p>
	When a package is installed, if the key <tt>install</tt> is present
	in the <tt>messages.json</tt> file, the value will be used as the
	file path to a txt file containing a message to display the user.
</p>

<p>
	When a package is upgraded, Package Control looks through each key
	in the <tt>messages.json</tt> file and shows the content of the
	text file that is a value of any key that is higher than the previous
	version of the package the user has installed. Thus if the user
	had version <tt>1.1.0</tt> installed, the txt files for <tt>1.2.0</tt>
	and <tt>1.1.1</tt> would be shown. If the user had version
	<tt>1.1.1</tt> installed, only the messages for version <tt>1.2.0</tt>
	would be shown.
