<h1>Creating Package Files</h1>

<p>
	If you are developing a package, and plan on doing custom repository
	hosting instead of using GitHub or BitBucket, Package Control includes
	two commands to assist in creating <tt>.sublime-package</tt> files from your
	package directories. These are <em>Create Package</em> and
	<em>Create Binary Package</em>, both of which can be run via the command
	palette.
</p>
<p>
	Running the <em>Create Package</em> command will prompt you to select a
	pakage to create the package file for. The packager
	exlcudes various VCS metadata, Sublime Text cache files and
	<tt>.pyc</tt> files by default. The list
	of excluded files can be tweaking through the
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-dirs_to_ignore">dirs_to_ignore</a>,
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-files_to_ignore">files_to_ignore</a>
	and <a href="/docs/settings#setting-files_to_include">files_to_include</a>
	settings.
</p>
<p>
	The command <em>Create Binary Package</em> works the same way as <em>Create
	Package</em>, however it uses different settings to control what is included
	and excluded. The default different is that with a binary package, all
	<tt>.py</tt> files except for <tt>__init__.py</tt> are excluded and all
	<tt>.pyc</tt> files are included. The list of excluded files can be tweaked
	through the <a href="/docs/settings#setting-dirs_to_ignore">dirs_to_ignore</a>,
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-files_to_ignore_binary">files_to_ignore_binary</a>
	and <a href="/docs/settings#setting-files_to_include_binary">files_to_include_binary</a>
	settings.
</p>
