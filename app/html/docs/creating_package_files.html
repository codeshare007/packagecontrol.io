<h1>Creating Package Files</h1>

<p>
	If you are developing a package, and plan on doing custom repository
	hosting instead of using GitHub or BitBucket, Package Control includes
	the command <em>Create Package</em> to assist in creating
	<tt>.sublime-package</tt> files from your package directories. This command
	is run via the command palette, and via the settings, allows you to
	customize what files are included in the output package file.
</p>

<h2>Package Profiles</h2>

<p>
	Before running the <em>Create Package</em> command, take a moment to review
	the various settings that control the output. Package Control ships with
	two profiles, <tt>Default</tt> and <tt>Binaries Only</tt>. Here are the
	settings the control the <tt>Default</tt> profile:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/docs/settings#setting-dirs_to_ignore"><tt>dirs_to_ignore</tt></a></li>
	<li><a href="/docs/settings#setting-files_to_ignore"><tt>files_to_ignore</tt></a></li>
	<li><a href="/docs/settings#setting-files_to_include"><tt>files_to_include</tt></a></li>
	<li><a href="/docs/settings#setting-package_destination"><tt>package_destination</tt></a></li>
</ul>

<p>
	The <a href="/docs/settings#setting-package_profiles"><tt>package_profiles</tt></a>
	setting allows created other named profiles that can override each of the
	settings listed above. By default, a single custom profile is included:
	<tt>Binaries Only</tt>. Copy the settings from <span class="menu">Preferences
	<em>&gt;</em> Package Settings <em>&gt;</em> Package Control <em>&gt;</em>
	Settings – Default</span> into <span class="menu">Preferences
	<em>&gt;</em> Package Settings <em>&gt;</em> Package Control <em>&gt;</em>
	Settings – User</span> and customize to suit your needs.
</p>

<h2>Running <em>Create Package</em></h2>

<p>
	Running the <em>Create Package</em> command will prompt you to select a
	pakage to create the package file for. Next, it will ask you to choose what
	package profile you would like to use. Package Control will then create
	a <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file, add the package files to it and place it
	in the <tt>package_destination</tt>.
</p>

<h2>.pyc Files</h2>

<p>
	With Sublime Text 2, all python files are compiled into <tt>.pyc</tt> files
	by default by Sublime Text itself. This allows you to choose if you want to
	ship a binary only-package. Python 3 in Sublime Text 3 changes how Python
	scripts are compiled, storing them all in a <tt>__pycache__/</tt> folder,
	which doesn't work if you are trying to ship a binary only package.
</p>

<p>
	Because of this, Package Control explicitly compiles all <tt>.py</tt> files
	into <tt>.pyc</tt> files, in the same directory, bypassing the
	<tt>__pycache__/</tt> for Sublime Text 3. So, while normally Python 2 and
	Python 3 are quite different when it comes to <tt>.pyc</tt> files, Package
	Control works around the issue. Please note, however, that it will still
	be required to ship a different version of the package for Sublime Text 2
	and Sublime Text 3 since they use different <tt>.pyc</tt> formats. This
	can be accomplished by running <em>Create Package</em> from Sublime Text 2
	for an ST2-compatible version of the package, and running
	<em>Create Package</em> from Sublime Text 3 for an ST3-compatible version.
